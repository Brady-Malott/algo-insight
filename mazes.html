              <h2>Wilson's Algorithm</h2>
              <p>
                Start by creating a maze board with empty tiles that are
                surrounded by a grid of maze walls.
              </p>
              <p>Pick an initial tile and mark it as a part of the maze.</p>
              <p>
                Start a random walk from a random tile that is not yet in the
                maze. Each time you walk to a new tile, store the direction of
                your next step on that tile. Continue walking randomly until you
                find a tile that is in the maze.
              </p>
              <p>
                Go back to where the random walk started and perform a "loop
                erasing walk". Follow the directions stored at each walked
                square, and mark the square (as well as the wall being pointed
                to) as parts of the maze (the broken wall becomes a passage, and
                the walked tile becomes a breadcrumb). Note that this will cut
                out any loops, because any square that is revisited in the
                random walk will be updated with a new direction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Keep performing random walks and loop erasing walks until every
                tile is visited. Then, break open a random point in the starting
                wall and the outer wall, and mark these points as the start and
                exit respectively. Lastly, erase the breadcrumbs.

                1. Start by creating a maze board with empty tiles that are
                surrounded by a grid of maze walls.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Pick an initial tile adjacent to the starting area at the
                center. Break the wall in between the tile and the center area.
                Mark this broken wall as the start.
              </p>
              <p>3. Mark this tile with a breadcrumb.</p>
              <p>
                4. Get a list of the empty neighbour tiles. Select a random tile
                and break the wall between the current tile and the selected
                tile. Then repeat steps 3-4 for the selected tile.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: If a tile has no unvisited neighbours (i.e. all the
                neighbours are marked with breadcrumbs), then backtrack to the
                previous tile. This is implemented with recursion.

              <h2>Prim's Algorithm</h2>
              <p>
                Start by creating a maze board with empty tiles that are
                surrounded by a grid of maze walls.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pick an initial tile adjacent to the center area and mark it as
                a part of the maze.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create a list to store walls, and add the walls that are
                adjacent to the initial tile to the list.
              </p>
              <p>
                While there are still walls in the list, remove a random wall
                from the list and get the cells adjacent to it. If one of these
                cells is not yet in the maze, break the wall, add the cell to
                the maze, and add this cells neighbour walls to the wall list.
              </p>
              <p>
                If both cells were already in the maze, then the wall is just
                removed from the list. Once there are no more walls in the wall
                list, set the exit tile on the outer wall and remove the
                breadcrumbs.

              <p>
                Start by creating a maze board with empty tiles that are
                surrounded by a grid of maze walls. These tiles are already
                marked as part of the maze (as "passages", shown as white
                squares).
              </p>
              <p>
                Store a list of unchecked walls, comprised of the walls that are
                adjacent to white squares. This excludes junctions and the outer
                wall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create a list of "cell sets", where a set is a group of unique
                items. Initially, each white tile has a corresponding set that
                stores its position in the maze.
              </p>
              <p>
                While there are still unchecked walls, select a random wall and
                get its 2 adjacent cells. For each adjacent cell, store the set
                that contains it in a list. If these sets are equal (i.e. these
                tiles are already connected in the maze), then just remove the
                wall from the unchecked walls list. If the cells belong to
                different sets, make the wall a passage, remove the two sets
                from the list of cell sets, and add the union of the two sets to
                the list of cell sets. The union of two sets is the set of
                unique entries from the combined sets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once every wall has been checked, then the whole maze will be
                connected, and there will be only one "cell set" in the cell
                sets list.

              <h2>Recursive Division</h2>
              <p>
                Start by creating a maze board with just an outer wall. The
                board must be an odd number of tiles wide and high.
              </p>
              <p>
                Make a vertical and horizontal divide through the maze chamber
                (you can only divide the maze into chambers of odd dimensions as
                well).
              </p>
              <p>
                Outward from the intersection of the walls spans 4 wall
                segments. Make a hole in 3 of these segments. Note that the hole
                may not be in the same line as a potential wall for its adjacent
                subchambers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Make a recursive function call on the 4 new subchambers. Repeat
                this process until every subchamber is either 1 tile wide or
                long.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, break open 2 of the 4 outer walls. Make one the starting
                point and one the exit point.

              <h2>Recursive-Backtracking Solver</h2>
              <p>1. Start from the green start tile.</p>
              <p>
                2. Begin by checking if this tile is the exit. If it is the
                exit, the maze is solved (the solver function returns true).
                Otherwise, mark the tile as visited (yellow tiles are visited).
              </p>
              <p>
                3. If the tile is not the exit, search for any neighbour
                "passage" tiles (excluding the center) and store them in an
                array. The passages are the tiles with a white background.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. Make a recursive call for each of the unvisited neighbour
                tiles (i.e. repeat step 2-3 on each neighbour). If one of the
                neighbours leads to the exit, true will be returned up the
                recursion stack. In this case, do not search the other unvisited
                neighbours.
              </p>
              <p>
                5. As true is returned up the recursion stack, colour each tile
                that is backtracked over golden yellow to mark it as a part of
                the solution.
              </p>
              <p>6. Reset all visited tiles to white "passage" tiles.</p>
